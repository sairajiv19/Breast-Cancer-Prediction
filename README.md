# Breast Cancer Prediction
This repository is for a breast cancer prediction software.\
It can predict if a cell is malignant or benign based on different parameters.\
It consists of various Machine Learning models which have been trained.\
These trained models are used to make a prediction.\
Thank You.\
**Note**\
1.Install scikit-learn, pandas and colorama to use the application.\
2.Also it contains an optional grid search script to find the best hyperparameters for Random forest classification model,\
  but is slow and takes a long time to find them.\
